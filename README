## 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
## 📘 Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.
We use multiple models — Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting — along with preprocessing pipelines and GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and improve accuracy.

## 🧩 Dataset
```
Train dataset: train.csv
Test dataset: test.csv
Target column: Survived
ID column: PassengerId
```
You can get the dataset from Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering
```
Different feature engineering techniques used:
Handle missing values in Age, Fare, and Embarked.
Extract Title from Name (e.g., Mr, Miss, Mrs, etc.).
Convert Sex to numeric (0 = male, 1 = female).
Create FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1.
Create IsAlone (1 if traveling alone, 0 otherwise).
Convert categorical variables (Embarked, Title) using OneHotEncoder.
Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
